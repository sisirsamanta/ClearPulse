   from src.data_collection import collect_github_data, collect_jira_data

   # Collect data from GitHub
   github_data = collect_github_data(repo_name='your-repo-name', token='your-github-token')

   # Collect data from Jira
   jira_data = collect_jira_data(project_id='your-project-id', email='your-email', token='your-jira-token')
   ```

2. **Preprocess Data**:
   ```python
   from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data

   # Preprocess the collected data
   processed_data = preprocess_data(github_data, jira_data)
   ```

3. **Generate Insights**:
