# Project Scope and Objective
This document outlines the scope and objectives of the ClearPulse project, which aims to create a system for analyzing developer activity using clustering algorithms and time-series analysis. The system will identify bottlenecks, provide personalized productivity insights, and suggest process improvements for software development teams.

## Impact
- Enhance team productivity.
- Identify areas for improvement in the development process.
- Optimize workflows and resource allocation.

## Project Phases
### Phase 1: Data Collection
- Identify data sources (Git, Jira).
- Integrate with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket APIs.
- Collect data points such as commit frequency, pull request times, code review comments, bug resolution times, and developer activity patterns.

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
- Clean and transform data.
- Perform feature engineering to derive additional insights.
- Segment developer workload and analyze performance trends over time.

### Phase 3: Model Development
- Use clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to group developers based on activity patterns.
- Apply time-series analysis (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future performance and identify bottlenecks.
- Implement anomaly detection to highlight unusual patterns.

### Phase 4: Bottleneck Identification & Insights Generation
- Detect workflow stages causing delays.
- Provide personalized insights and process improvement suggestions.

### Phase 5: Visualization and Reporting
- Develop interactive dashboards to display key performance metrics.
- Generate automated reports summarizing team performance and suggesting improvement actions.

### Phase 6: System Integration & Deployment
- Integrate the system into existing workflows.
- Provide user roles and access control.
- Deploy the system on cloud infrastructure for scalability.

## Monitoring and Feedback Loop
- Regularly evaluate model performance and update with new data.
- Allow feedback from team members and managers to improve the system.

## Impact Evaluation
- Track key metrics such as time saved, developer satisfaction, and team performance.
- Measure improvements through surveys and historical data analysis.

## Technologies & Tools
- Data Collection & Integration: GitHub/GitLab API, Jira REST API.
- Data Processing: Pandas, Numpy.
- Model Building: Scikit-learn, K-Means, DBSCAN, ARIMA, LSTM.
- Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Plotly/Dash.
- Deployment: Flask/Django, AWS/Azure.
